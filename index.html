      <h2 class="subtitle">Who was Alan Turing?</h2>
      <p class="text">
        Alan Mathison Turing (23 June 1912 - 7 June 1954) was an English
        mathematician, computer scientist, logician, cryptanalyst,
        philosopher, and theoretical biologist. Turing was highly influential
        in the development of theoretical computer science, providing a
        formalisation of the concepts of algorithm and computation with the
        Turing machine, which can be considered a model of a general-purpose
        computer. Turing is widely considered to be the father of theoretical
        computer science and artificial intelligence.

            ALAN TURING IS THE FATHER OF MODERN COMPUTER SCIENCE.

          <p class="about-fact">
            Turing essentially pioneered the idea of computer memory. In 1936,
            Turing published a seminal paper called “On Computable Numbers”,
            which The Washington Post has called “the founding document of the
            computer age.” In the philosophical article, he hypothesized that
            one day, we could build machines that could compute any problem
            that a human could, using 0s and 1s. Turing proposed single-task
            machines called Turing machines that would be capable of solving
            just one type of math problem, but a “universal computer” would be
            able to tackle any kind of problem thrown at it by storing
            instructional code in the computer’s memory. Turing’s ideas about
            memory storage and using a single machine to carry out all tasks
            laid the foundation for what would become the digital computer.

            ALAN TURING PLAYED A KEY ROLE IN WINNING WORLD WAR II.
          </p>
          <p class="about-fact">
            Turing began working at Bletchley Park, Britain’s secret headquarters for its codebreakers during World War
            II, in 1939. By one estimate, his work there may have cut the war short by up to two years. He’s credited
            with saving millions of lives.
            <br>
            Turing immediately got to work designing a codebreaking machine called the Bombe (an update of a previous
            Polish machine) with the help of his colleague Gordon Welchman. The Bombe shortened the steps required in
            decoding, and 200 of them were built for British use over the course of the war. They allowed codebreakers
            to decipher up to 4000 messages a day.
            <br>
            His greatest achievement was cracking the Enigma, a mechanical device used by the German army to encode
            secure messages. It proved nearly impossible to decrypt without the correct cipher, which the German forces
            changed every day. Turing worked to decipher German naval communications at a point when German U-boats were
            sinking ships carrying vital supplies across the Atlantic between Allied nations. In 1941, Turing and his
            team managed to decode the German Enigma messages, helping to steer Allied ships away from the German
            submarine attacks. In 1942, he traveled to the U.S. to help the Americans with their own codebreaking work.

          <p class="about-fact">
            Like many geniuses, Turing was not without his eccentricities. He wore a gas mask while riding his bike to
            combat his allergies. Instead of fixing his bike’s faulty chain, he learned exactly when to dismount to
            secure it in place before it slipped off. He was known around Bletchley Park for chaining his tea mug to a
            radiator to prevent it from being taken by other staffers.

          <p class="fact">ALAN TURING WAS PROSECUTED FOR BEING GAY.</p>
          <p class="about-fact">
            In 1952, Turing was arrested after reporting a burglary in his home. In the course of the investigation, the
            police discovered Turing’s relationship with another man, Arnold Murray. Homosexual relationships were
            illegal in the UK at the time, and he was charged with “gross indecency.” He pled guilty on the advice of
            his lawyer, and opted to undergo chemical castration instead of serving time in jail.

          <p class="fact">
            THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT ONLY RECENTLY APOLOGIZED FOR ALAN TURING'S
            CONVICTION.
          </p>
          <p class="about-fact">
            In 2009, UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown issued a public apology to Turing on behalf of the British
            government. “Alan and the many thousands of other gay men who were convicted as he was convicted under
            homophobic laws were treated terribly,” Brown said. "This recognition of Alan's status as one of Britain's
            most famous victims of homophobia is another step towards equality and long overdue." Acknowledging
            Britain’s debt to Turing for his vital contributions to the war effort, he announced, “on behalf of the
            British government, and all those who live freely thanks to Alan's work I am very proud to say: we're sorry,
            you deserved so much better."
            <br>
            His conviction was not actually pardoned, though, until 2013, when he received a rare royal pardon from the
            Queen of England.
